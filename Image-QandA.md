## Installation

To run this code, you'll need to install the required Python packages. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers requests Pillow torch
```

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Python script where the code is located. It should look like the following:

```python
!pip install transformers requests Pillow torch 
from transformers import ViltProcessor, ViltForQuestionAnswering
import requests
from PIL import Image

# Rest of the code...
```

3. Replace the `url` variable with the URL of the image you want to use for question answering.

4. Modify the `text` variable to specify the question you want to ask about the image.

5. Run the Python script. It will load the Vilt model, process the image and question, and provide a predicted answer based on the content of the image.

## Example

In the provided code, the image is set to a URL of a house with a blue roof, and the question is "what is the colour of the house?". When you run the code, it will predict the answer based on the image, and you'll see the predicted answer in the console.
