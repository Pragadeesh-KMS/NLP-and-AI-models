# Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with Whisper and Audio Recording

This repository contains a Python script that utilizes the OpenAI Whisper ASR model for automatic speech recognition and enables you to record and transcribe audio in real-time using a web-based interface. Whisper is a powerful ASR model that can convert spoken language into written text. You can use this code for various applications, such as transcribing interviews, meetings, or any other spoken content.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
3. `transformers` library - You can install it using pip with `!pip install transformers -q`.

## Usage

1. Open a Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab environment.
2. Copy the code provided in this repository into your notebook.
3. Execute the code cell by cell.

The code consists of the following components:

1. Installation of necessary libraries, including `transformers` for ASR.
2. JavaScript code for audio recording.
3. Recording audio by running the JavaScript code.
4. Saving the recorded audio as "audio.wav."
5. Transcribing the recorded audio using the Whisper ASR model.

## Recording Audio

The JavaScript code within the notebook allows you to record audio directly within your web browser. It provides a simple interface with "Start Recording" and "Stop Recording" buttons. Follow these steps to record audio:

1. Click the "Start Recording" button to begin recording.
2. Speak into your microphone.
3. Click the "Stop Recording" button when you're finished.

The recorded audio will be saved as "audio.wav."

## Transcribing Audio

After recording, the code uses the Whisper ASR model to transcribe the audio into text. The transcribed text will be displayed in the notebook.
