## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies and have set up your Hugging Face credentials:

1. Python
2. `hugchat` library - You can install it using pip with `!pip install hugchat`.
3. A Hugging Face account with your email and password.
4. The provided character descriptions are examples, but you can create your own character descriptions for roleplay.

## Usage

1. Open a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Copy the code provided in this repository into your Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Execute the code cell by cell.

The code is divided into the following sections:

1. Installation of the HugChat library and login using your Hugging Face account.
2. Creating a ChatBot using your Hugging Face credentials.
3. Initiating a conversation with a predefined prompt, which defines the character and interaction format.

## Creating a Character Roleplay

The script begins with a character description provided to the AI. You can replace the character description with your own custom character if desired. The character description includes details about the character's appearance, personality, background, skills, and more.

The character's responses are generated based on this description, creating a character roleplay experience. The AI responds to user inputs in the persona and style of the character described.

## Character Interaction

After providing the character description, you can interact with the AI by sending messages or prompts. The AI will respond to your inputs as if it were the character, allowing for engaging and dynamic conversations.

## Character Limitations

It's important to note that the AI's responses are limited to the character's knowledge and personality. The character may not have knowledge of certain topics or may respond in a specific way based on their personality traits.

## Customization

You can modify the character description, persona, and prompts to create unique character interactions and roleplay scenarios.
