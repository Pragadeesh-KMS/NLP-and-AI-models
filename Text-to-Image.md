## Installation

Before using this code, make sure you have the necessary packages installed. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install diffusers --upgrade --quiet
pip install invisible_watermark transformers accelerate safetensors
```

## Usage

1. Import the required libraries:

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline, EulerDiscreteScheduler
import torch
```

2. Initialize the model and scheduler:

```python
model_id = "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base"
scheduler = EulerDiscreteScheduler.from_pretrained(model_id, subfolder="scheduler")
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, scheduler=scheduler, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to("cuda")
```

3. Set your text prompt:

```python
prompt = "HORSE IN SEA"
```

4. Generate an image based on the text prompt:

```python
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
```

5. Save the generated image to a file (e.g., "3.png"):

```python
image.save("3.png")
```

## Note

- Make sure you have a CUDA-compatible GPU to take advantage of GPU acceleration when running the code on a GPU.

- You can customize the `prompt` variable to generate images based on different text prompts.

- Ensure you have proper permissions to write to the directory where you intend to save the generated image.

Feel free to modify and extend this code to suit your specific needs and use cases.

For more information, please refer to the documentation of the libraries used in this code.
